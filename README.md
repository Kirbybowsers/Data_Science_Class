# Write A Data Science Post 


# Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. As a programmer in the U.S., should I work for a smaller company or a larger company? 
2. What is the salary difference among companies in different sizes?
3. What is the WFH policy difference among companeis with different sizes?
4. Which type of companies have the highest ratings on job satisfaction and career satisfaction? 

# Descriptions

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.


# Results

The main findings of the code can be found in the code file.
